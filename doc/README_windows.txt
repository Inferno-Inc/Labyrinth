Labyrinth Core
=============

Intro
-----
Labyrinth Core (LAB) is an open source, Bitcoin-derived digital currency which serves as the core of our escrow service.
Labyrinth Escrow is the platform where multiple parties can transact between each other, under predefined conditions,
without the need of trust. This is possible due to conditions being set and executed similar to smart contracts.
The entire transaction validation happens on chain, rendering the usual escrow attacks impractical.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run labyrinth-qt.exe.

Labyrinth Core is the original Labyrinth client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Labyrinth transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
